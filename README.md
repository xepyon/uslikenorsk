# uslikenorsk

Uslikenorsk is designed to be an enhanced intuitive Norwegian keyboard layout that mixes the functionality of Norwegian keyboard with a more international standard
keyboard layout to help us to Code and use the terminal.

### Why I decided to use uslikenorsk?

Well, First of all I am a foreigner in Norway. And in all my jobs but the last one I had always used UNIX and Windows laptops with Norwegian layout.
So when I was told that I was going to be given a Macbook I thought to myself "Well, same same... How difficult can it be to get use?", but it did not take long to realize how naive I was!.

## Layouts

Quick clarification: **alt** equals **option** key.

### Basic layers of the keylayout

The biggest difference is that in the basic keyboard layout we are not able to press the character **å**. But it is easily pressed using the **alt** key before pressing it (or **shift+alt+å** for **Å**)
